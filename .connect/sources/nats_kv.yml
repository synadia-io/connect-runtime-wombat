      A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas
      it will be expanded into multiple URLs.

    description: >-
      Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should
      be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure
      if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages
      will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency
      of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded
      immediately upon consumption and mutation.
