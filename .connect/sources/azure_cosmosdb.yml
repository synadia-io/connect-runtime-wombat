fields:
  - path: endpoint
    name: endpoint
    label: Endpoint
    type: string

    label: Connection String
    type: string
    description: >-
      A CosmosDB connection string.

  - path: database
    name: database
    label: Database
    type: string
    description: >-
      The name of the database to query.

  - path: container
    name: container

    type: string
    description: >-
      A Bloblang mapping which should evaluate to a single partition key value or an array of partition key values of type string, integer or boolean. Currently, hierarchical partition keys are not supported so only one value may be provided.

  - path: auto_replay_nacks
    name: auto_replay_nacks
    label: Automatically Replay Nacks
    type: bool
    default: true
    description: >-
      Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.
