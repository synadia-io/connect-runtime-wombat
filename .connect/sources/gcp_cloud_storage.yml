      The scanner by which the stream
      of bytes consumed will be broken out into individual messages. Scanners are useful
      for processing large sources of data without holding the entirety of it within
      memory. For example, the `csv` scanner allows you to process individual CSV rows
      without loading the entire CSV file in memory at once.
