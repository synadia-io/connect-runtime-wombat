  Subscribe to a NATS subject.
fields:
  - path: urls
    name: urls
    label: URLs
    type: string
    kind: list
    description: >-
      A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas
      it will be expanded into multiple URLs.
    examples:
      - - "nats://127.0.0.1:4222"
      - - "nats://username:password@127.0.0.1:4222"

  - path: subject
    name: subject
    label: Subject
    type: string
    description: >-
      A subject to consume from. Supports wildcards for consuming multiple
      subjects. Either a subject or stream must be specified.
    examples:
      - "foo.bar.baz"
      - "foo.*.baz"
      - "foo.bar.*"
      - "foo.>"

  - path: auto_replay_nacks
    name: auto_replay_nacks
    label: Auto Replay Nacks
    type: bool
    optional: true
    default: true
    description: >-
      Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should
      be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure
      if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages
      will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency
      of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded
      immediately upon consumption and mutation.

  - path: send_ack
    name: send_ack
    label: Send Ack
    type: bool
    optional: true
    default: true
    description: >-
      Control whether ACKS are sent as a reply to each message. When enabled,
      these replies are sent only once the data has been delivered to all outputs.

    label: Nak Delay
    type: string
    optional: true
    description: >-
