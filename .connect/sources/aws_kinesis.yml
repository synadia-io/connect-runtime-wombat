fields:
  - path: streams
    name: streams
    label: Streams
    type: string
    kind: list
    description: >-
      One or more Kinesis data streams to consume from. Streams can either
      be specified by their name or full ARN. Shards of a stream are automatically balanced
      across consumers by coordinating through the provided DynamoDB table. Multiple
      comma separated streams can be listed in a single element. Shards are automatically
      distributed across consumers of a stream by coordinating through the provided
      DynamoDB table. Alternatively, it's possible to specify an explicit shard to consume
      from with a colon after the stream name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the shard
      `0` of the stream `foo`.
    examples:
      - - "foo"
        - "arn:aws:kinesis:*:111122223333:stream/my-stream"

          Whether, if the table does not exist, it should be created.

        label: Billing Mode
        type: string
        optional: true
        default: "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
        description: >-
          When creating the table determines the billing mode.

        name: read_capacity_units
        label: Read Capacity Units
        optional: true
        default: 0
        type: int
        description: >-
          Set the provisioned read capacity when creating the table with a
          `billing_mode` of `PROVISIONED`.
      - path: dynamodb.write_capacity_units
        name: write_capacity_units

        type: int
        default: 0

          `billing_mode` of `PROVISIONED`.

  - path: checkpoint_limit
    name: checkpoint_limit
    label: Checkpoint Limit
    optional: true
    default: 1024
    type: int
    description: >-
      The maximum gap between the in flight sequence versus the latest acknowledged
      sequence at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and
      batching at the output level to work on individual shards. Any given sequence
      will not be committed unless all messages under that offset are delivered in order
      to preserve at least once delivery guarantees.

  - path: auto_replay_nacks
    name: auto_replay_nacks
    label: Auto Replay Nacks
    optional: true
    default: true
    type: bool
    description: >-
      Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should
      be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure
      if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages
      will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency
      of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded
      immediately upon consumption and mutation.

    label: Lease Period
    type: string
    optional: true
    default: 30s
    description: >-
      The period of time after which a client that has failed to update a
      shard checkpoint is assumed to be inactive.

  - path: start_from_oldest
    name: start_from_oldest
    label: Start From Oldest

      yet exist for the stream.
