      The time interval at which messages should be generated, expressed either as a duration string or as a cron  expression. If set to an empty string messages will be generated as fast as downstream services can process them.  Cron expressions can specify a timezone by prefixing the expression with `TZ=<location name>`, where the location  name corresponds to a file within the IANA Time Zone database.

      An optional number of messages to generate, if set above 0 the specified number of messages is generated and  then the input will shut down.

    description: |-
      Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely,  eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these  messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high  throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.
