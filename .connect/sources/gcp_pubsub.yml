  Consumes messages from a GCP Cloud Pub/Sub subscription.
fields:
  - path: project
    name: project
    label: Project
    type: string
    description: >-
      GCP project where the subscription exists.

  - path: credentials_json
    name: credentials_json
    label: Credentials JSON
    type: string
    description: >-
      JSON credentials for authenticating with GCP.

  - path: subscription
    name: subscription
    label: Subscription
    type: string
    description: >-
      The ID of the subscription to consume messages from.

  - path: endpoint
    name: endpoint
    label: Endpoint
    type: string
    default: ""
    optional: true
    description: >-
      Allows you to specify a custom endpoint for the GCP API. For a list of valid values, 
      see [this document](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/service_apis_overview#list_of_regional_endpoints).

  - path: sync
    name: sync
    label: Sync
    type: bool
    optional: true
    default: false
    description: >-
      Whether to consume messages synchronously. If set to `true`, messages will be consumed
      one at a time and the next message will not be consumed until the current message has been
      acknowledged. If set to `false`, messages will be consumed in parallel and the next message
      will be consumed immediately after the current message has been acknowledged. This can
      improve throughput but may result in out-of-order message delivery.

  - path: max_outstanding_messages
    name: max_outstanding_messages
    label: Max Outstanding Messages
    type: int
    default: 1000
    optional: true
    description: >-
      The maximum number of unacknowledged messages to allow before pausing consumption. If set to `0`,
      consumption will never pause. This can be used to control the rate of consumption and prevent
      out-of-memory errors in the case of slow message processing.

  - path: max_outstanding_bytes
    name: max_outstanding_bytes
    label: Max Outstanding Bytes
    type: int
    optional: true
    default: 100000000
    description: >-
      The maximum number of unacknowledged bytes to allow before pausing consumption. If set to `0`,
      consumption will never pause. This can be used to control the rate of consumption and prevent
      out-of-memory errors in the case of slow message processing.
