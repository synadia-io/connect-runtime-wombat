  Sends message parts as files to a HDFS directory.
    
    Each file is written with the path specified with the 'path' field, in order to have a different path for 
    each object you should use function interpolations described 
    [here](https://wombat.dev/pipelines/learn/interpolation/#bloblang-queries).
fields:
  - path: hosts
    name: hosts
    label: Hosts
    kind: list
    type: string
    optional: false
    examples:
      - localhost:9000
    description: |-
      A list of target host addresses to connect to.
  - path: user
    name: user
    label: User
    kind: scalar
    type: string
    default: '""'
    optional: true
    description: |-
      A user ID to connect as.
  - path: directory
    name: directory
    label: Directory
    kind: scalar
    type: string
    optional: false
    description: |-
      A directory to store message files within. If the directory does not exist it will be created.
  - path: path
    name: path
    label: Path
    kind: scalar
    type: string
    default: '"${!counter()}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt"'
    optional: true
    description: |-
      The path to upload messages as, interpolation functions should be used in order to generate unique file paths.
  - path: max_in_flight
    name: max_in_flight
    label: Max In Flight
    kind: scalar
    type: int
    default: '64'
    optional: true
    description: |-
      The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.
  - path: batching
    name: batching
    label: Batching
    kind: scalar
    type: object
    optional: false
    examples:
      - byte_size: 5000
        count: 0
        period: 1s
      - count: 10
        period: 1s
      - check: this.contains("END BATCH")
        count: 0
        period: 1m
    description: |-
      Allows you to configure a [batching policy](https://wombat.dev/pipelines/learn/batching/#batch-policy).
    fields:
      - path: batching.count
        name: count
        label: count
        kind: scalar
        type: int
        default: '0'
        optional: true
        description: |-
          A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.
      - path: batching.byte_size
        name: byte_size
        label: byte_size
        kind: scalar
        type: int
        default: '0'
        optional: true
        description: |-
          An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

        description: |-
          A [Bloblang query](https://wombat.dev/pipelines/learn/interpolation/#bloblang-queries) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.
