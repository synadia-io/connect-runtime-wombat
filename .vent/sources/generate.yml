description: >-
  Generates messages at a given interval using a Bloblang mapping executed without a context. This allows you to 
  generate messages for testing your pipeline configs.
fields:
  - path: mapping
    name: mapping
    label: Mapping
    type: string
    render_hint: sourcecode
    description: >-
      A Bloblang mapping to use for generating messages.
    examples:
      - root = "hello world"
      - root = {"test":"message","id":uuid_v4()}

  - path: interval
    name: interval
    label: Interval
    type: string
    description: >-
      The time interval at which messages should be generated, expressed either as a duration string or as a cron 
      expression. If set to an empty string messages will be generated as fast as downstream services can process them. 
      Cron expressions can specify a timezone by prefixing the expression with `TZ=<location name>`, where the location 
      name corresponds to a file within the IANA Time Zone database.
    default: "1s"
    optional: true
    examples:
      - "5s"
      - "1m"
      - "1h"
      - "@every 1s"
      - "0,30 */2 * * * *"
      - "TZ=Europe/London 30 3-6,20-23 * * *"

  - path: count
    name: count
    label: Count
    type: int
    description: >-
      An optional number of messages to generate, if set above 0 the specified number of messages is generated and 
      then the input will shut down.
    default: 0
    optional: true

  - path: batch_size
    name: batch_size
    label: Batch Size
    type: int
    description: >-
      The number of generated messages that should be accumulated into each batch flushed at the specified interval.
    default: 0
    optional: true

  - path: auto_replay_nacks
    name: auto_replay_nacks
    label: Auto Replay Nacks
    type: bool
    description: >-
      Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, 
      eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these 
      messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high 
      throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.
    default: true
    optional: true
