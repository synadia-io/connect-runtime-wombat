# Component Testing Report for connect-runtime-wombat

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented automated testing for all 75 components in the connect-runtime-wombat project. All components now pass validation using `wombat lint` with appropriate minimal configurations.

## Test Results

| Component Type | Total | Passed | Failed |
|----------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Scanners       | 5     | 5      | 0      |
| Sources        | 31    | 31     | 0      |
| Sinks          | 39    | 39     | 0      |
| **Total**      | **75** | **75** | **0**  |

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Test Infrastructure

**File:** `test_all_components.go`
- Automated test script that discovers and validates all components
- Reads component specifications from `.connect/` directory
- Generates minimal valid wombat configurations for each component
- Validates configurations using `wombat lint`
- Reports results with timing information
- Saves detailed results to JSON format

### 2. Key Implementation Details

#### Component Discovery
- Automatically finds all YAML files in `.connect/scanners/`, `.connect/sources/`, and `.connect/sinks/`
- Parses component specifications to extract the component name

#### Configuration Generation
- Creates minimal but valid configurations for each component type:
  - **Sources**: Paired with a `drop` output
  - **Sinks**: Paired with a `generate` input that produces test data
  - **Scanners**: Nested under `stdin` input with appropriate scanner configuration

#### Validation
- Uses `wombat lint` command to validate each generated configuration
- Captures both success/failure status and error messages
- Measures execution time for each validation

### 3. Component-Specific Configurations

The test script includes tailored minimal configurations for each component family:

#### NATS Components
- `nats`, `nats_jetstream`: URLs and subject
- `nats_kv`: URLs, bucket, and key (for output)

#### AWS Components
- `aws_s3`: Bucket and region
- `aws_sqs`: Queue URL and region
- `aws_kinesis`: Stream(s) and region
- `aws_dynamodb`: Table and region
- `aws_sns`: Topic ARN and region

#### Azure Components
- `azure_blob_storage`: Storage account, key, and container
- `azure_cosmosdb`: Endpoint, account key, database, container, and partition keys
- `azure_queue_storage`: Storage account, key, and queue name
- `azure_table_storage`: Storage account, key, and table name

#### Database Components
- `mongodb`: URL, database, collection, and query (for input)
- `cassandra`: Addresses and query
- `redis_*`: URL and appropriate keys/channels/streams
- `elasticsearch`/`opensearch`: URLs, index, and action

#### Message Queue Components
- `kafka_franz`: Brokers, topics, and consumer group (for input)
- `amqp_0_9`/`amqp_1`: URLs and queue/exchange configurations
- `pulsar`: URL, topics, and subscription
- `nsq`: Addresses, topic, and channel

#### Other Components
- `http_client`: URL endpoint
- `gcp_*`: Project, buckets, datasets, tables as appropriate
- `timeplus`: URL, API key, and query/stream
- `sftp`: Address, path, and credentials

### 4. Scanner Configuration Fix

Initially, scanners were incorrectly configured. The fix involved:
- Understanding that scanners must be nested under inputs that support them
- Changed from attempting to use `file` or `generate` inputs to using `stdin` input
- Properly nested scanner configuration under the input's scanner field

Example fix:
```yaml
# Before (incorrect)
input:
  generate:
    count: 1
  scanner:
    lines: {}

# After (correct)
input:
  stdin:
    scanner:
      lines: {}
```

### 5. Test Output

The script generates:
- Console output with success/failure indicators (✓/✗)
- Execution time for each component
- Summary statistics
- `test_results.json` with detailed results including:
  - Component name and type
  - Success status
  - Error messages (if any)
  - Configuration file path
  - Execution duration

## Files Created

1. **test_all_components.go** - Main test script
2. **test_configs/** - Directory containing generated test configurations
3. **test_results.json** - Detailed test results in JSON format

## Usage

To run the tests:
```bash
go run test_all_components.go
```

To clean and re-run:
```bash
rm -rf test_configs && go run test_all_components.go
```

## Conclusion

All 75 components in the connect-runtime-wombat project now have validated minimal configurations. The test infrastructure provides:
- Automated validation of component configurations
- Quick feedback on configuration changes
- Documentation of minimal required fields for each component
- A foundation for more comprehensive testing in the future

The testing revealed that many components have specific required fields beyond just connection parameters, and the test script now provides appropriate minimal values for all of them.
